# Flow.ai Backlog
Public place to post and discuss issues and feature requests for Flow.ai

## Bugs and Feature requests
Found a bug or have a great idea for a new feature? Awesome, please let us know!

### Reporting
You can easily [report any issue or feature request](https://github.com/flow-ai/backlog/issues/new) using a special template. Before you do, please take just a few moments of your time to check if it isn't reported or requested by someone else. We wouldnâ€™t want to waste any of your time. 

### Overview
Using the template really helps us making everything organised. This site is not just for reporting new stuff but also gives you a [complete overview](https://github.com/flow-ai/backlog/issues) where we are working on.
